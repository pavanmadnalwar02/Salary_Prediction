# 🚀 Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict salaries based on key factors such as Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, and Years of Experience using Machine Learning techniques. By leveraging regression models, the project provides valuable insights into salary trends and helps professionals make data-driven compensation decisions.

# 🎯 Objectives
✅ Analyze salary distribution across different job roles, experience levels, and demographics.\
✅ Implement Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest Regression models for salary prediction.\
✅ Identify the most influential factors affecting salary.\
✅ Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for better visualization.\

# 🏆 Key Features
🔹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning – Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.\
🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing salary trends and relationships between features.\
🔹 Feature Engineering – Selecting key variables like experience, education, and job title.\
🔹 Machine Learning Models – Comparing different regression techniques to find the best model.\
🔹 Hyperparameter Tuning – Optimizing models for better accuracy.\
🔹 Salary Insights & Trends – Identifying pay gaps, high-paying industries, and experience-based salary growth.\

# 📊 Dataset Used
The dataset contains salary details of professionals from various industries. The key features include:

Age 🏆
Gender 👩‍💻👨‍💻
Education Level 🎓
Job Title 💼
Years of Experience ⏳

# ⚡ Tech Stack
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
🔹 Machine Learning Models
    Linear Regression
    Polynomial Regression
    Ridge Regression
    Lasso Regression
    Random Forest Regression
🔹 Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and modeling
🔹 Power BI for interactive salary visualizations
# 📈 Model Performance
Each model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R² Score, and Cross-Validation to ensure reliability. The Random Forest Regression model provided the best accuracy due to its ability to handle non-linearity and complex relationships in salary data.

# 📌 Salary Insights
🔹 Experience Level is the most important factor influencing salary.
🔹 Higher Education leads to better salaries but varies by job role.
🔹 Gender Pay Gap exists in some industries, indicating potential disparities.
🔹 Tech and Finance sectors offer significantly higher salaries.

# 🔍 Results & Conclusion
This project successfully predicts salaries with high accuracy and provides actionable insights for HR professionals, job seekers, and companies. By using Machine Learning & Data Visualization, we can better understand salary structures and trends across industries.

# 🚀 Future Enhancements
✅ Deploy a Web App using Streamlit for real-time salary predictions.
✅ Implement Deep Learning techniques (Neural Networks).
✅ Collect more real-world salary data to improve model accuracy.
